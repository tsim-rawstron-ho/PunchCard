# PunchCard #

A small industry accounting app. Our app is the employee-facing application that allows users to clock-in,
and out from shift-work(E.G. shifts in a bar, or coffee-house). This is similar to other applications which 
large companies produce, however we want to produce a more simplistic user-interface that's enjoyable to use. 

## User Stories ##
### User ###
